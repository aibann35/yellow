        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Yellow things can be found all around us, from nature's
           masterpieces to man-made creations. Fields of golden
            wheat sway in the summer breeze, while a buzzing bee
            flits from one yellow blossom to another, collecting
            nature's sweet nectar. From radiant yellow fruits like 
            bananas and lemons to the comforting glow of a cozy yellow
             room, this color has the power to uplift and inspire. 
             Whether it's a splash of yellow in an artwork or the 
             cheerful hue of a child's raincoat, yellow things have 
             the remarkable ability to brighten our days and fill our 
             hearts with a sense of optimism and delight.
